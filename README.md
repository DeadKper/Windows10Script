# Windows10Script
- Description

This is a script to auto-install basic programs and configure a fresh windows 10 instalation or just configure an existent windows 10.
This also auto-activates windows 10 and office.

To use this open https://git.io/JLGaJ on edge or any other webclient, then copy the first commented line (without the "#") and paste it on a powershell window.
Admins privilege is not needed since it has code to elevate itself but it's recommended in case it can't gain admin
